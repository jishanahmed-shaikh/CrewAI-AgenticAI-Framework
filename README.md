## 🏗️ Understanding the Architecture

### 🤖 Agent Components

```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Your Agent's Job Title",           # 🎭 What they do
    goal="What they want to achieve",        # 🎯 Their objective
    backstory="Their background story",      # 📚 Their expertise
    verbose=True,                           # 📢 Show their work
    tools=[custom_tools]                    # 🛠️ Special abilities
)
```

### 📋 Task Structure

```python
task = Task(
    description="What needs to be done",     # 📝 The assignment
    expected_output="What you expect",       # ✅ Success criteria
    agent=assigned_agent                     # 🤖 Who does it
)
```

### 👥 Crew Assembly

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],        # 🤖 The team
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],            # 📋 The work
    verbose=True                            # 📊 Show progress
)
```

## 🛠️ Creating Custom Tools

Want to give your agents superpowers? Here's how to create custom tools:

```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CustomToolInput(BaseModel):
    parameter: str = Field(..., description="Tool parameter")

class CustomTool(BaseTool):
    name = "ToolName"
    description = "What this tool does"
    args_schema = CustomToolInput
    
    def _run(self, parameter: str) -> str:
        # Your tool logic here
        return f"Tool executed with: {parameter}"
```
